              Hi there! My name is I Putu Nanda Amanta or you can just call me
              Nanda or Putu. I live in Gianyar, Bali, Indonesia. On this 2022
              I'm 19 years old. Currently, I'm Backend Software Engineer with
              1.5++ year experience in Java using Micronaut and Spring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beside that I also know or familiar with Nodejs(Express),
              Python(Flask & Djago), GO because I ever learn and I usually use
              one of them like NodeJs for my freelance project.
            </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold">My Journey on Programming</h5>
        <p>
          I have been starting to learn Programming since 2019 because I was
          really curious about "how to build a game", on that age I loved to
          play some PS2 game with my familly or my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing that I learn was Website Development. I learned HTML5,
          CSS, JavaScript and I got used to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the end of 2019. I really wanted to handle a professional project,
          therefore I showed of what can I do to my website freelancer friends
          and then they're impressed. After that they started to ask me to help
          them to do their web project. That's how I started my carrer as a web
          dev freelancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          while I was working on my freelace projects, I was still learning like
          Python, NodeJs, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 2020. one of my singaporean friend, and my indonesian friend
          insterested to ask me to help their companny (<a
            target="_blank"
            href=" https://kampungkode.org"
            >Kampungkode</a
          >) to do their projects. Because of that, I thought I need a team to
          do this and I decided to build a team with some of my friends to
          handle
          <a target="_blank" href=" https://kampungkode.org">Kampungkode</a>'s
          projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
            <div class="card-image">
              <div class="card-image-front">
                <img src="asset/img/nanda2.jpeg" alt="Nanda Amanta's Photo" />
              </div>
              <div class="card-image-back">
                <p>Hai</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 pt-md-0 pt-4">
            <p>
              On 2021. we decided to have a label for our team, because we
              wanted to looking for a project independently with our name. now
              our team name is EXP Group. Currently, we don't have our website
              yet but it's still on development.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          after a long time, I found my self was better on Backend Development
          because I really loved to handle database, manage data, implement some
          DSA concept and many thing about Backend Development. Then I decided
          to focus on Backend Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still on 2021. I just started to working on a startup logistic
          companny in Bali, it was Global Logistic Express as Backend Engineer.
          they were using Reactive Java Micronaut,Reactive MongoDb, Kafka,
          Cassandra, Aws ,etc as their tech stack.
